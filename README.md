Greetings! In this project we will use machine learning to predict customer churn. The data used was extracted from kaggle can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn).

## Context:

Telco is a fictional company that provides Telephone, Internet and Television services. The company realizes that the clients are churning, that is, canceling their services with them, and wants to use the
machine learning power to detect the clients that are going to churn before it happens. By doing so, Telco is able to use customer loyalty strategies to prevent it.

## Objectives:

To help Telco in the task of preventing churn, we have to build a machine learning model that is capable of predicting which customers are going to churn based on diverse information about them, collected by the company.

## The Data Used:

The data used to train and test the model is provided by Telco, and it consists of diverse information about clients who did and didn't churn. The dataset contains information about services the customer has signed up for, about their account and relationship with the company and about various demographic aspects. The dataset also has a column with the target value, that is, the information if that client churned or not within the last month.
